- 👋 Hello, my name is Ruben.
- 🎯 My interests include programming and configuring services, particularly self-hosting them locally. Additionally, I occasionally fine-tuning large language models and vision models, as well as deploying and running them locally.
- 🔧 C/C++, Python, Bash, SQL, and JavaScript are amongst the languages in which I am confident.
- 📫 You can contact me by email at hello@rubenlopes.uk or by filling out my [contact me form](https://www.rubenlopes.uk) on my website.
